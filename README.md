# tabter
An alternative to share and filter Google Sheets with a better experience in mind.

## Availability
This tool is available online [here](https://tabter-3e979.firebaseapp.com/). You can host it elsewhere if you like it but please give credit where is due.

## Context
Since Google Sheets doesn't let you filter documents unless you have permissions to edit the file, so I created this little tool to do that with any document.

## How to use
Insert a Google Sheet link in the landing page and click __go__!

The link must belong to a public document (no need for editing permissions) and contain the `document-id` and `page-id` in this way:
```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<document-id>/edit#gid=<page-id>
```

In the online version there's an example with links to an example document and its results.
